Form Application 

This form application lets users enter text, checkboxes, and radio buttons. In order to guarantee that complete and accurate data is entered, the input fields are validated.

Features include text, radio buttons, and checkboxes as input fields. Regular expressions (regex) are used for field validation. If the submit button is clicked with any empty fields, error messages are displayed. After the form has been submitted and validated, a new page with all the filled data is displayed. This assists in ensuring that the entered data are formatted appropriately.

Error Messages When the submit button is clicked, an error message will appear if any of the fields are left blank. Before proceeding to the subsequent step, this ensures that the user provides all of the necessary information.

Display of Filled Data After the form has been submitted and validated successfully, the user will be taken to a new page where they can see all of the data they entered. The user can check the accuracy of their input with this summary of the data.
